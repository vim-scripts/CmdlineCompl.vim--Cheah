Description:

Based on ideas from the above two plugins, but also adds the following features:
 * Word completion in a regular command line. (in addition to word completion in a search command line)
 * Word completion in the middle of the command line. (not just the end of the command line)

To use, hit F12 while in the command line. Hit F12 again to get a different completion. Repeated invocations will cycle through all possible completions. Word completion will be done in the context of the current buffer.

Customization:

To inhibit loading of this plugin, define the loaded_cmdline_compl variable.

To change the key mapping, cmap the desired key to <Plug>CmdlinecomplComplete. For example:

    cmap <F11> <Plug>CmdlinecomplComplete
